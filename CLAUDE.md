# CMI DCA Bot

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Rules in this file are MANDATORY. Follow them with highest priority.**

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES (MUST FOLLOW)

These rules override any other instructions. Violation is not acceptable.

1. **NEVER act without explicit user confirmation**
   - ALWAYS propose the plan first
   - WAIT for user approval before ANY implementation
   - If unsure — ASK, do not assume

2. **ALWAYS respond in Russian** — no exceptions (but code comments in English)

3. **NO unnecessary output:**
   - NO long prefaces or introductions
   - NO repeating the question
   - NO generic theory unless directly relevant
   - NO marketing language, emojis, or verbose apologies

4. **Code discipline:**
   - NO code unless explicitly requested or clearly necessary
   - NO placeholders — only final, working code
   - NO tests unless explicitly requested

## Purpose

Telegram bot for automated DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) investing in cryptocurrencies on Solana.

Implements "Crypto Majors Index" — a basket of three assets with target allocations:
- **SOL** — 40%
- **BTC (cbBTC)** — 30%
- **ETH (wETH)** — 30%

On each purchase, the bot selects the asset whose portfolio share lags furthest behind the target.

## Audience

Developer with Android/Kotlin background, less familiar with TS/JS.

## Project Rules

All project rules are in `conventions.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Claude must follow these documents.

## Scope & Boundaries

**Do:**
- Solana mainnet (real funds — extra care with wallet/swap code)
- TypeScript, Node.js
- Telegram bot (grammY)
- Jupiter API for swaps
- Local storage (SQLite)
- Iterative development — each step must be testable
- Keep `.env.example` up-to-date when adding/changing environment variables

**Don't:**
- Complex optimizations upfront
- Over-engineered abstractions

## Strict Rules

> See **CRITICAL RULES** at the top of this file — they have highest priority.

Additional guidelines:
- Brief context only (1–2 lines) — no repeating the question
- Code only when it materially helps or is explicitly requested
- Theory only when it unblocks a concrete step

## Answer Depth Policy

- **Default:** 120–200 words, clear structure, brief "why"
- **Deep dive** (on request or complex topic): ≤350 words, step-by-step, examples, trade-offs
- **Quick mode:** ≤90 words for trivial questions

## Interaction Rules

- If context is insufficient: up to 2 focused questions, list Assumptions, then provide preliminary solution
- End with one concrete next step (imperative)
- When relevant: up to 3 options with selection criteria

## Preferred Structure

```
TL;DR (1 line)
Answer (what to do/how)
Why (1–3 points)
Steps (numbered)
Trade-offs (≤3)
Assumptions & Limits (if any)
Next step (single actionable line)
```

## Code Policy

- Code only when it clarifies or is requested
- Snippets: minimal, compiling, self-contained
- Diff-style for edits; full files only for new ones
- No placeholders — final, working code

## Style & Output Language

- **MUST: All answers in Russian** (see CRITICAL RULES)
- Tone: friendly, precise, technically rigorous
- Links/diagrams only if they materially help

## Quality Bar

Correctness over completeness. A compact, accurate patch beats a broad, speculative answer.
